# CDLI Tablet App made using Flutter

<b>ABOUT</b> : CDLI already has it's Android and iPad application published on stores to allow users of app to learn about ancient history, one entry at a time. By "entry", I mean daily entry, the current apps add a new entry each day to give the users something new to look and learn each day. These entries contain an image of an artifact/cunieform/sculptures of historical interests, along with a description about them.<br><br>

<b>PURPOSE</b> : This project works on to build a new mobile application for CDLI developed
completely by Flutter so that we won’t need two seperate mobile applications for both
android and iOS devices, this would help in saving lots of time and energy which goes in
maintaining both the apps. This project also gave me an opportunity to learn about Flutter, and at the same time, to work on my first Open Source Project.<br><br>


> <br> And, the URL that we’ll be using to fetch data is :
https://cdli.ucla.edu/cdlitablet_android/fetchdata.php<br><br>

<b>SMALL DEMO :</b><br>
The current CDLI mobile applications do not have a welcome screen, so I thought it could be one of the new features to add a new route which would include everything that the app contains, but in a brief manner. Due to this, user can quickly absorb what the app is all about.<br>

>Note : <br>
>-Here, the tag "Entry of the day" tag will automatically come under the latest entry each day.

>-I have used a timer to make sure that the image shift to left side after every 5 seconds.
